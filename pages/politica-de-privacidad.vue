              RB's Puerto Rico Inc. Online Privacy Policy RB's Puerto Rico Inc.
              is sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to its website.
              The purpose of this Online Privacy Policy is to describe what
              types of personal information we collect from users and visitors
              to RB's Puerto Rico, website, www.arbyspr.com, any other website
              (including mobile sites), and mobile applications operated by RB's
              Puerto Rico Inc. or by a Service Provider on behalf of RB's Puerto
              Rico Inc. The purposes for which we use the information, what
              rights you have regarding your personal information, and to whom
              and under what circumstances we disclose your personal
              information. Application This privacy policy ( "Privacy Policy")
              applies only to information collected through our website and
              related web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets,
              blogs and their respective content, as well as any other
              interactive content, including, but not limited to, content that
              redirects to our website and related web pages, as well as
              Twitter, Facebook or other social networking sites and their
              respective content, whether accessed through a computer, a mobile
              device or other technology (collectively referred to as the
              "Website"). The Website is provided by RB's Puerto Rico Inc, web
              designers and other promotional partners (collectively referred to
              as "Arby's Puerto Rico", "us" or "our"). Arby's Puerto Rico stores
              two types of user information: anonymous information, such as the
              information collected by cookies and the records files, surveys,
              and personal information that we provide for certain services.
              This Privacy Statement describes Arby's practices in Puerto Rico
              and in the United States of America in connection with the
              information we collect through the websites we operate from which
              you access this Privacy Statement, including www.arbyspr.com and
              other websites owned or controlled by us (collectively, the
              "Websites"), through software applications that we make available
              for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the
              "Applications"), through our pages in the social networks we
              control from which you access to this Privacy Statement
              (collectively, our "Social Network Pages"), by means of emails
              with HTML format that we send to you and that link to this Privacy
              Statement and through your communications with us. Anonymous
              information - "Cookies" and log files A "cookie" is a data stored
              on the user's hard disk containing information about the user. The
              use of a cookie is not linked in any way to personal information,
              until a user provides such information (see below). If a user
              rejects or deletes the cookie, you can still use our site. The
              only drawback that this presents is that the user will be limited
              in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able
              to receive notices of special offers, nor participate in any
              contest that can be made. Cookies also allow us to track and group
              behavior flow data for clicks. By doing this, we can better
              respond to the interests of our users and improve their
              experiences on our site. Arby's Puerto Rico also maintains records
              of Web standards that store data for all visitors to this website.
              These records contain: 1. The Internet domain from which you visit
              this site. 2. Your address I.P. (Your computer is automatically
              assigned an IP address when you are surfing the Internet.) Your IP
              address is static or dynamic, it is possible to identify you
              through a static IP address, otherwise the dynamic IP address
              cannot be traced. 3. The type of internet browser you use and the
              operating system you use. 4. The time and date you visited this
              website. 5. The pages you visited within our homepage. 6. The
              address of the website on which the link (link) is located that
              directed you to our website. Arby's Puerto Rico uses information
              from web and "clickstream" records to identify popular features.
              This way, we can design our website in such a way that the page is
              more useful and easier to use by users. Web logs are stored in
              sequential files, and we do not attempt to identify users using
              these logs unless exceptional circumstances occur. Examples of
              exceptional situations that could arise are when users attempt to
              break, disturb, or damage our website, in which case we may use
              our Web records to identify such persons. In the same manner, we
              may provide information from our Web log to law enforcement
              agencies if we understand that there is evidence of violations of
              federal, state, or local law, or the possibility of such
              occurrence. 7. Voluntary offering of personal information. Users
              can choose to provide personal information (name, email address,
              telephone number, etc.) to provide services such as franchise
              information, franchise opportunities, campaign notifications, as
              well as requesting information, satisfaction surveys, products or
              studies on advertising and brand image and contests, site
              announcements and special offers at the time of application or in
              the future. By providing us with personal or other information,
              you accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement. If
              you provided us with your e-mail address and you no longer wish to
              receive notices, you can delete your name from our list of notices
              by sending an e-mail to sales@fransglobal.com by telephone or by
              mail (see contact information below). When you subscribe to
              certain services and offers on our site, we may share names or
              other necessary contact information with any third party
              associated with these services. Arby’s Puerto Rico will share the
              information in accordance with the privacy policy in force at the
              time it collects the information. If a user's personal information
              changes, we will find a way to correct or update that personal
              information. This can be done by sending an email to
              sales@fransglobal.com or by contacting RBs'sPuerto Rico Inc. as
              indicated below. Security Arby's Puerto Rico takes reasonable
              precautions to protect the information of our users, both while
              transmitting the information and after receiving it. We seek to
              use reasonable, organizational, technical, and administrative
              measures to protect personal information in our organization.
              Unfortunately, it cannot be guaranteed that a data storage or
              transmission system is 100% secure. If you suspect that your
              interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you
              believe the security of your account has been compromised), please
              inform us immediately in accordance with the "Contact" section,
              shown below. In addition, once we receive the information, we use
              industry-standard security policies and procedures to protect it
              from loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, use,
              modification and / or disclosure. If you have questions about the
              security of our website, you can send an email to

              reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. We
              will post changes to this page so that users always know what
              information we store, how it is used and under what circumstances
              we disclose it. We will use, share and disclose the information in
              accordance with the privacy policy in force at the time of
              gathering the information. Required Disclosures Arby's Puerto Rico

              organization and offers a global service. Sharing information
              across borders is essential for "Services" so that you can receive
